'this form started on 10 Sep.
    'I am about halfway done with the code in the actual edit sub in the original file--not including the SUBs that really do the work; I've only
'done 1 of those(PrintHex).
    '12 Sep: I have coded all but 1 sub: suggest. I think this is the Big One that we're all dreading...
    '14 Sep: Oh wait, I missed hexequiv; I know it was too good to be true when I saw how short suggest was(it's nearly done, BTW)
    '15 Sep: I'm in the process of debugging this form--it's going well(kind of) so far the only bug I've found so far in my 2 min. testing has
'been the fact that the last key you pressed which is then converted into hex stays in the entry box--I'll have to figure a way to get around that.
'Yess! It works great (to the exception of the last key appearing bug which is merely annoying) also I haven't tested the suggest or the
'enter hex directly mode. Later: They work perfectly as far as I can tell; no bugs encounted in normal use let's say. I can't believe this is so EASY!
    '19 Sep: I am altering this form so it does double duty for both edit and finddd; there will be two form startup and two form close functions,
'one for each mode of use.
    '20 Sep: Yes! The search appears to work perfectly although I haven't tested the } key that turns 16 bit on...whatever *that* is.
    '7 Oct: Fixed a couple of bugs(off by 1 errors) and added another label to display hex on its own. I'm clearing the text box all the time now
'Also I'm fixing the 'backspace' bug where you would enter a non-valid key and then back space it and it would delete the last valid
'char(s) entered. I'm not fixing that...I'm fixing the crash you got if an invalid key was the *only* key currently entered.
'Of note is the fact that I think that bug might have been in the original thingy...the code is *still* buggy...suggest does *not* work right
'with stuff like 'ra' but no 'r' in the table. This makes it a pain to hack a Japanese game to Japanese using romaji because you can't type in
'anything except that has all the characters in there but the last one: the example I'm thinking of:
'       5F=Heart
'     You can't type Heart in directly and have it be recognized *unless* you also have the following in the table:
'       6F=H    70=He   71=Hea  72=Hear
'   this is a bug which I am not sure I am up to fixing...but I sure have a good description of it!
'MUCH later: I have a pretty good idea of how to fix this bug...it'll have to wait until after the relative
'search is in, though.
